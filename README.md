# COMP 551 Project 3: Modified MNIST

In this project we include three code files: feature extraction, baseline model and VGG. Feature extraction includes our preprocess work of binarization, clustering and image filtering with preserved detail. Baseline model is our designed baseline model which is a simple CNN with four layers. VGG is the model we implemented in this project, including both VGG of 16 layers and 19 layers. The baseline model and VGG both run on Google Colab.
