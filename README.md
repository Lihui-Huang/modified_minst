# COMP 551 Project 3: Modified MNIST

In this project we include two code files, XXX, YYY and ZZZ. XXX is used for feature extraction, it includes binarization, clustering and image filtering with preserved detail. YYY is our designed baseline model. ZZZ is the VGG we designed and implemented in this project, including both VGG of 16 layers and 19 layers. Both YYY and ZZZ run on Google Colab.
